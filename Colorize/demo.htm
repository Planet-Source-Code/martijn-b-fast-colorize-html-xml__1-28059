<p>1 August 2001: A <a href="Guide/xhtml-m12n-tutorial/">tutorial on XHTML
Modules and Markup Languages</a> is now available.
This tutorial explains how to create XHTML Family modules and markup languages,
based on <a href="#xhtml-modularization">Modularization of XHTML</a>.</p>

<p>8 June 2001: The third draft of the <a
href="../TR/2001/WD-xhtml-events-20010608/">XHTML Events</a>
specification has been published.
The XHTML Events module provides XHTML
host languages the ability to uniformly integrate event listeners
and associated event handlers with Document Object Model
(DOM) Level 2 event interfaces. The result is to provide XHTML
based languages an interoperable way of associating behaviors with
document-level markup.
In addition, this specification defines a subset of the XHTML Events
module called basic events for use on simpler client devices. Finally,
the XHTML Event Types Module defines the XHTML language event types.</p>

<p>31 May 2001: W3C is pleased to announce the publication of
<a href="../TR/2001/REC-xhtml11-20010531/">XHTML 1.1 -

Recommendation</a>, together with
<a href="../TR/2001/REC-ruby-20010531/">Ruby Annotation</a>.
The specifications are stable, and have been
reviewed by the W3C Membership, who favor their adoption by industry.
XHTML 1.1 is a reformulation of XHTML 1.0 Strict based on XHTML
modules, including the ruby module. Ruby is a short run of text
alongside base text typically used in East Asian documents to indicate
pronunciation or annotation. Read the <a rel="details"

<h2><a id="whatis" name="whatis">What is HTML?</a></h2>

<p>HTML is the <em>lingua franca</em> for publishing hypertext on
the World Wide Web. It is a non-proprietary format based upon
<acronym title="Standard Generalized MarkUp Language">SGML</acronym>, and
can be created and processed by a wide range of tools, from simple plain
text editors - you type it in from scratch- to sophisticated <acronym
title="What You See Is What You Get">WYSIWYG</acronym> authoring tools.
HTML uses tags such as <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>
to structure text into headings, paragraphs, lists, hypertext links etc.
Here is a <a href="Guide/">10-minute guide</a> for newcomers to HTML. W3C's
statement of direction for HTML is given on the <a
href="Activity">HTML Activity Page</a>. See also the page on
our work on the <a href="Forms/">next generation of Web
forms</a>, and the section on <a href="#historical">Web
history</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="mission" name="mission">Mission of the HTML Working
Group</a></h2>

<p>To develop the next generation of HTML as a suite of XML tag
sets with a clean migration path from HTML 4. Some of the
expected benefits include: reduced authoring costs, an improved
match to database &amp; workflow applications, a modular solution
to the increasingly disparate capabilities of browsers, and the
ability to cleanly integrate HTML with other XML applications.
For further information, see the <a
href="2000/Charter">Charter</a> for the <a
href="Group/">HTML Working Group</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="recommendations" name="recommendations">Recommendations</a></h2>

<p>W3C produces what are known as "Recommendations" for HTML/XHTML.
These are specifications, developed by W3C working groups, and
then voted in by Members of the Consortium. A W3C Recommendation
indicates that consensus has been reached among the Consortium
Members that a specification is appropriate for widespread
use.</p>

<p class="navbar"><a
href="#xhtml1">XHTML 1.0</a> |
<a href="#html4">HTML 4.01</a> |
<a href="#xhtml-basic">XHTML Basic</a> |
<a href="#xhtml-modularization">Modularization of XHTML</a> |
<a href="#xhtml11">XHTML 1.1</a></p>

<h3><a id="xhtml1" name="xhtml1" href="../TR/xhtml1">XHTML 1.0</a></h3>

<p>XHTML 1.0 is the W3C's first Recommendation for XHTML,
following on from <a href="#previous">earlier work</a> on HTML 4.01,
HTML 4.0, HTML 3.2 and HTML 2.0. With a wealth of features, XHTML 1.0
is a reformulation of HTML 4.01 in XML, and combines the strength of
HTML 4 with the power of XML.</p>

<p>XHTML 1.0 is the first major change
to HTML since HTML 4.0 was released in 1997. It brings the rigor
of XML to Web pages and is the keystone in W3C's work to create
standards that provide richer Web pages on an ever increasing
range of browser platforms including cell phones, televisions,
cars, wallet sized wireless communicators, kiosks, and
desktops.</p>

<p>XHTML 1.0 is the first step and the <a href="Group/">HTML
Working Group</a> is busy on the next. XHTML 1.0 reformulates
HTML as an XML application. This makes it easier to process and
easier to maintain. XHTML 1.0 borrows the tags from W3C's earlier
work on HTML 4, and can be interpreted by existing browsers, by
following a few simple guidelines. This allows you to start using
XHTML now!</p>

<p>You can roll over your old HTML documents into XHTML using
W3C's Open Source <a href="../People/Raggett/tidy">HTML Tidy</a>
utility. This tool also cleans up markup errors, removes clutter
and prettifies the markup making it easier to maintain.</p>

<h4><a id="flavors" name="flavors">Three "flavors" of XHTML 1.0:</a></h4>

<p>XHTML 1.0 is specified in three "flavors". You specify which
of these variants you are using by inserting a line at the
beginning of the document. For example, the HTML for this
document starts with a line which says that it is using XHTML
1.0 Strict. Thus, if you want to validate the document, the
tool used knows which variant you are using. Each variant has its
own DTD - Document Type Definition - which sets out the rules and
regulations for using HTML in a succinct and definitive manner.</p>

<ul>
<li id="xhtml1-strict">
<p><b>XHTML 1.0 Strict</b> - Use this when you want really clean
structural mark-up, free of any tags associated with layout. Use
this together with W3C's Cascading Style Sheet language (<a
href="../Style/CSS/">CSS</a>) to get the font, color, and layout
effects you want.</p>
</li>

<li id="xhtml1-transitional">
<p><b>XHTML 1.0 Transitional</b> - Many people writing Web pages for
the general public to access might want to use this flavor of XHTML
1.0. The idea is to take advantage of XHTML features including
style sheets but nonetheless to make small adjustments to your
mark-up for the benefit of those viewing your pages with older
browsers which can't understand style sheets. These include using
BODY with bgcolor, text and link attributes.</p>
</li>

<li id="xhtml1-frameset">
<p><b>XHTML 1.0 Frameset</b> - Use this when you want to use HTML
Frames to partition the browser window into two or more
frames.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The complete <a href="../TR/xhtml1">XHTML 1.0
specification</a> is available in English in several formats,
including HTML, PostScript and <acronym
title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym>. See also the <a
href="translations#xhtml1">list of translations</a> produced by
volunteers.</p>

<!--
<h2 id="xhtml1-html4"><a href="../TR/xhtml1">XHTML 1.0</a> and <a
href="../TR/html4">HTML 4.01</a></h2>
-->

<h3><a id="html4" name="html4" href="../TR/html4">HTML 4.01</a></h3>

<p><a href="../TR/html4">HTML 4.01</a> is a revision of the HTML
4.0 Recommendation first released on 18th December 1997. The
revision fixes minor errors that have been found since then. The
XHTML 1.0 spec relies on HTML 4.01 for the meanings of HTML tags.
This allowed us to reduce the size of the XHTML 1.0 spec very
considerably.</p>

<h3><a id="xhtml-basic" name="xhtml-basic"
href="../TR/xhtml-basic">XHTML Basic</a></h3>

<p>XHTML Basic is the second Recommendation in a series of XHTML
specifications.</p>

<p>The <acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>
Basic document type includes the minimal set of modules required to be
an <acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>
Host Language document type, and in addition it includes images, forms,
basic tables, and object support.
It is designed for Web clients that do not support the full set of
<acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>
features; for example, Web clients such as mobile phones,
<acronym title="Personal Digital Assistant">PDA</acronym>s,
pagers, and settop boxes. The document type is rich enough for
content authoring.</p>

<p><acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>
Basic is designed as a common base that may be extended. For example,
an event module that is more generic than the traditional <acronym
title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> 4 event system could
be added or it could be extended by additional modules from <acronym
title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>
Modularization such as the Scripting Module. The goal of
<acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>
Basic is to serve as a common language supported by various kinds of
user agents.</p>

<p>The document type definition is implemented using
<acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language">XHTML</acronym>
modules as defined in "<cite><a href="#xhtml-modularization"
>Modularization of <acronym title="Extensible HyperText Markup Language"
>XHTML</acronym></a></cite>".</p>

<p>The complete <a href="../TR/xhtml-basic">XHTML Basic
specification</a> is available in English in several formats,
including HTML, plain text, PostScript and PDF. See also the <a
href="translations#xhtml-basic">list of translations</a> produced by
volunteers.</p>

<h3><a id="xhtml-modularization" name="xhtml-modularization"
href="../TR/xhtml-modularization">Modularization of XHTML</a></h3>

<p>Modularization of XHTML is the third Recommendation in a series of
XHTML specifications.</p>

<p>This Recommendation specifies an abstract modularization of XHTML and
an implementation of the abstraction using XML Document Type Definitions
(DTDs). This modularization provides a means for subsetting and extending
XHTML, a feature needed for extending XHTML's reach onto emerging platforms.
</p>

<p>Modularization of XHTML will make it easier to combine with markup tags
for things like vector graphics, multimedia, math, electronic
commerce and more. Content providers will find it easier to
produce content for a wide range of platforms, with better
assurances as to how the content is rendered.</p>

<p>The modular design reflects the realization that a
one-size-fits-all approach will no longer work in a world where
browsers vary enormously in their capabilities. A browser in a
cellphone can't offer the same experience as a top of the range
multimedia desktop machine. The cellphone doesn't even have the
memory to load the page designed for the desktop browser.</p>

<p>See also <a href="modularization">an overview of
XHTML Modularization</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="xhtml11" name="xhtml11" href="../TR/xhtml11"
>XHTML&#8482; 1.1 - Module-based XHTML</a></h3>

<p>This Recommendation defines a new XHTML document type that is based
upon the module framework and modules defined in Modularization of XHTML.
The purpose of this document type is to serve as the basis for future
extended XHTML 'family' document types, and to provide a consistent,
forward-looking document type cleanly separated from the deprecated,
legacy functionality of HTML 4 that was brought forward into
the XHTML 1.0 document types.</p>

<p>This document type is essentially a reformulation of XHTML 1.0
Strict using XHTML Modules. This means that many facilities available
in other XHTML Family document types (e.g., XHTML Frames) are not
available in this document type. These other facilities are available
through modules defined in Modularization of XHTML, and document
authors are free to define document types based upon XHTML 1.1 that
use these facilities (see Modularization of XHTML for information on
creating new document types).</p>

<h4><a id="differences" name="differences">What is the difference
between XHTML 1.0, XHTML Basic and XHTML 1.1?</a></h4>

<p>The first step was to reformulate <a href="#html4">HTML 4</a>
in XML, resulting in <a href="#xhtml1">XHTML 1.0</a>.
By following the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#guidelines">HTML
Compatibility Guidelines</a> set forth in Appendix C of the XHTML 1.0
specification, XHTML 1.0 documents could be compatible with existing
HTML user agents.</p>

<p>The next step is to modularize the elements and attributes into
convenient collections for use in documents that combine XHTML with
other tag sets. The modules are defined in
<a href="#xhtml-modularization">Modularization of XHTML</a>.
<a href="#xhtml-basic">XHTML Basic</a> is an example of fairly
minimal build of these modules and is targeted at mobile applications.</p>

<p><a href="#xhtml11">XHTML 1.1</a> is an example of a larger build
of the modules, avoiding many of the presentation features.
While XHTML 1.1 looks very similar to XHTML 1.0 Strict, it is designed
to serve as the basis for future extended XHTML Family document types,
and its modular design makes it easier to add other modules as needed or
integrate itself into other markup languages.
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/appendixa.html#parsing_module">XHTML
1.1 plus MathML 2.0</a> document type is an example of such XHTML Family
document type.</p>

<p>The increasing disparities between the capabilities of

developers wishing to reach a wide audience. A promising approach
is to formally describe profiles for documents intended for broad
groups of browsers, for instance, separate document profiles for
browsers running on desktops, television, handhelds, cellphones
and voice browsers. Document profiles provide a basis for
interoperability guarantees. If an author develops content for a
given profile and a browser supports the profile then the author
may be confident that the document will be rendered as expected.
The requirements for document profiles are analyzed.</p>

<h3><a id="guidelines" name="guidelines">Guidelines for
authoring</a></h3>

<p>Here are some rough guidelines for HTML authors. If you use
these, you are more likely to end up with pages that are easy to
maintain, look acceptable to users regardless of the browser they
are using, and can be accessed by the many Web users with
disabilities. Meanwhile W3C have produced some more formal
guidelines for authors. Have a look at the detailed <a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10">Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines 1.0</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><b>A question of style sheets.</b> For most people the look of
a document - the color, the font, the margins - are as important
as the textual content of the document itself. But make no
mistake! HTML is not designed to be used to control these aspects
of document layout. What you should do is to use HTML to mark up
headings, paragraphs, lists, hypertext links, and other
structural parts of your document, and then add a style sheet to
specify layout separately, just as you might do in a conventional
Desk Top Publishing Package. That way, not only is there a better
chance of all browsers displaying your document properly, but
also, if you want to change such things as the font or color,
it's really simple to do so. See the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/Style">Touch of style</a>.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>FONT tag considered harmful!</b> Many filters from
word-processing packages, and also some HTML authoring tools,
generate HTML code which is completely contrary to the design
goals of the language. What they do is to look at a document
almost purely from the point of view of layout, and then mimic
that layout in HTML by doing tricks with FONT, BR and <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>
(non-breaking spaces). HTML documents are supposed to be
structured around items such as paragraphs, headings and lists.
Yet some of these documents barely have a paragraph tag in sight!</p>

<p>The problem comes when the content of pages needs to be
updated, or given a new layout, or re-cast in XML (which is now
to be the new mark-up language). With proper use of HTML, such
operations are not difficult, but with a muddle of non-structural
tags it's quite a different matter; maintenance tasks become
impractical. To correct pages suffering from injudicious use of
FONT, try the <a href="/People/Raggett/tidy/">HTML Tidy
program</a>, which will do its best to put things right and
generate better and more manageable HTML.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Make your pages readable by those with disabilities.</b>
The Web is a tremendously useful tool for the visually impaired
or blind user, but bear in mind that these users rely on speech
synthesizers or Braille readers to render the text. Sloppy
mark-up, or mark-up which doesn't have the layout defined in a
separate style sheet, is hard for such software to deal with.
Wherever possible, use a style sheet for the presentational
aspects of your pages, using HTML purely for structural
mark-up.</p>

<p>Also, remember to include descriptions with each image, and
try to avoid server-side image maps. For tables, you should
include a summary of the table's structure, and remember to
associate table data with relevant headers. This will give
non-visual browsers a chance to help orientate people as they
move from one cell to the next. For forms, remember to include
labels for form fields.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Do look at the <a href="../WAI/Resources/#gl">accessibility
guidelines</a> for a more detailed account of how to make your
Web pages really accessible.</p>

<h3><a id="validation" name="validation"
href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML Validation Service</a></h3>

<p>To further promote the reliability and fidelity of
communications on the Web, W3C has introduced the W3C HTML
Validation Service at <a
href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a>.</p>

<p>Content providers can use this service to validate their Web
pages against the XHTML 1.0 and HTML 4 Recommendations, thereby
ensuring the maximum possible audience for their Web pages.
In addition, it can be used to check conformance against previous
versions of HTML, including the W3C Recommendation for HTML 3.2 and
the IETF HTML 2.0 standard.</p>

<p>To allow authors to broaden their audience even further to
those with disabilities, the service will be updated according to
the guidelines produced by W3C's Web Accessibility Initiative
(<acronym title="Web Accessibility Initiative">WAI</acronym>).
You can also test your pages for accessibility using the Web-based
<a href="http://www.cast.org/bobby/">Bobby</a> service.</p>

<p>Software developers who write HTML editing tools can ensure
interoperability with other Web software by verifying that the
output of their tool complies with the W3C Recommendations for
HTML.</p>

<h4><a href="../People/Raggett/tidy">HTML Tidy</a></h4>

<p>W3C also provides a stand-alone tool for checking and
pretty-printing HTML that is in many cases able to fix up mark-up
errors. <a href="../People/Raggett/tidy">HTML Tidy</a> is
available as W3C open source software, and also offers a means to
convert existing HTML content into well-formed XML, for delivery
as XHTML.</p>

<p>There is an <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/html-tidy/">archived</a>
public mailing list html-tidy@w3.org. Please send bug reports /
suggestions on HTML Tidy to this mailing list.</p>

<h3><a id="historical" name="historical">Some early ideas for HTML</a></h3>

<p>The Web owes its origins to many people, starting back in
medieval times with the development of a rich system of cross
references and marginalia. The basic document model for the Web
was set: things in the page such as the text and graphics, and
cross references to other works. These early hypertext links were
able to able to target documents to a fine level thanks to
conventions for numbering lines or verses.</p>

<p>Vannevar Bush in the 1940's, in his article <a
href="http://www.ps.uni-sb.de/~duchier/pub/vbush/vbush.shtml">As
we may think</a>, describes his vision for a computer aided
hypertext system he named the <i>memex</i>. His vivid description
of browsing the Web of linked information, includes the ability
to easily insert new information of your own, to add to the
growing web. Dr. Bush was the Director of the US Office of
Scientific Research and Development, and coordinated war time
research in the application of science to war.</p>

<p>Other visionaries include <a
href="http://www.bootstrap.org/org.htm#Douglas">Douglas Engelbart</a>,
who founded the Augmentation Research Center at the Stanford Research
Institute (<acronym title="Stanford Research Institute">SRI</acronym>)
in 1963. He is widely creditied with helping to develop the computer
mouse, hypertext, groupware and many other seminal technologies. He now
directs the <a href="http://www.bootstrap.org">Bootstrap Institute</a>,
which  is dedicated to the development of collective IQ in networked
communities.</p>

<p><a href="http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/elab/hfl0155.html">Ted
Nelson</a> has spent his life promoting a global hypertext system
called <em>Xanadu</em>. He coined the term <em>hypertext</em>, and is
well known for his books: <em>Literary Machines</em> and <em>Dream
Machines</em>, which describe hypermedia including branching
movies, such as the film at the Czechoslovakian Pavilion at Expo
`67.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.lirmm.fr/ftp/ACMSIGWEB/index.html"><acronym
title="Association for Computing Machinery">ACM</acronym>
<abbr title="Special Interest Group on Hypertext, Hypermedia and Web"
>SIGWEB</abbr></a>, formerly SIGLINK, has for many years been the center
for academic research into hypertext systems, sponsoring a series
of annual conferences. SIGLINK was formed in 1989 following a
workshop on hypertext, held in 1987 in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.</p>

<p><a
href="http://www.savetz.com/ku/ku/quick_genius_behind_hypercard_bill_atkinson_the_november_1987.html"
>Bill Atkinson</a> best known for <em>MacPaint</em>, an easy to use
bitmap painting program, gave the world its first popular
hypertext system <em>HyperCard</em>. Released in 1987, HyperCard
made it easy for anyone to create graphical hypertext applications.
It features bitmapped graphics, form fields, scripting and fast full
text search. HyperCard is based on a stack of cards metaphor with
shared backgrounds. It spawned imitators such as Asymmetrix Toolbook
which used drawn graphics and ran on
the <acronym title="Personal Computer">PC</acronym>.
The <acronym title="Office Workstations Ltd">OWL</acronym> Guide was
the first professional hypertext system for large scale applications,
it predates HyperCard by one year and followed in the footsteps made
by Xerox <em>NoteCards</em>, a Lisp-based hypertext system, released
in 1985.</p>

<p>Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Caillau both worked at
<acronym title="Conseil Europ&#233;en pour la Recherche Nucl&#233;aire"
lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">CERN</acronym>, an
international high energy physics research center near Geneva. In
1989 they collaborated on ideas for a linked information system
that would be accessible across the wide range of different
computer systems in use at CERN. At that time many people were
using <em>TeX</em> and <em>PostScript</em> for their documents. A few
were using <em>SGML</em>. Tim realized that something simpler was
needed that would cope with dumb terminals through high end
graphical X Window workstations. HTML was conceived as a very
simple solution, and matched with a very simple network protocol
HTTP.</p>

<p>CERN launched the Web in 1991 along with a mailing list called
www-talk. Other people thinking along the same lines soon joined
and helped to grow the web by setting up Web sites and
implementing browsers, such as, Cello, Viola, and MidasWWW. The
break through came when the National Center for Supercomputer Applications
(<acronym title="National Center for Supercomputer Applications"
>NCSA</acronym>) at Urbana-Champaign encouraged Marc Andreessen and
Eric Bina to develop the X Window <em>Mosaic</em> browser. It was
later ported to <acronym title="Personal Computer">PC</acronym>s and
<abbr title="Macintosh">Mac</abbr>s and became a run-away sucess story.
The Web grew exponentially, eclipsing other Internet based information
systems such as WAIS, Hytelnet, Gopher, and UseNet.</p>

<p>We hope to extend this summary and are interested in getting
hold of screen shots and feature lists for early browsers. This
is your chance to help! You may also be interested in Marc Weber
